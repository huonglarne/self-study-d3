# Self study data visualization with d3.js

Self studying Data Visualization with d3.js. The textbook I am using is D3.js in Action: Data visualization with JavaScript by Elijah Meeks.

Most of the codes are referenced from the examples in the books but with my own changes and experiments.

## Chapter 1: Basics

Get used to SVG and DOM elements.

Learn basic data chaining and binding techniques.

## Chapter 2: Data flow

Read data from CSV and JSON files and bind them to objects.

Create channels to represent features.

Make simple bar chart and scatter plot.

## Chapter 3: Design interactivity

Make simple animation to switch from one feature to another and to emphasize.
